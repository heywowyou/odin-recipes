    <h3>Chicken Chickpea Burgers with self ground chicken</h3>

    <p>
      This burger is made with ground chicken and chickpeas, which yields a very
      interesting texture and a nice bite.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Chicken Thighs</li>
      <li>Chickpeas</li>
      <li>White Onion</li>
      <li>Chile Powder</li>
      <li>Smoked Paprika</li>
      <li>Coarse Salt</li>
      <li>Black Pepper</li>
      <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        To start, separate the chicken thighs into skins, meat, and bones. The
        bones can be kept for stock. Cut each chicken thighs into roughly
        one-inch chunks and the skin into two-inch sheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a scale, weigh out the lean chicken chunks. Calculate how much
        skin needs to be added to make a 90% lean, 10% fat mixture (example: I
        had 11 oz of chicken thigh, so I used about 1.2 oz of skin). Spread out
        the chicken on a baking sheet and place in the freezer for 15-20
        minutes. This will help prevent smearing in the food processor. Note:
        While you wait mash the chickpeas, mince the onion, prepare the yogurt
        sauce, and any other burger toppings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the partially frozen chicken thighs and skin in the bowl of a food
        processor and pulse about 10-15 times until a ground chicken mixture
        forms. Test it by picking some up and see if you can form it in your
        hands. Note: The chicken can also be hand-chopped into the ground meat
        as I did in my chicken nugget recipe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now to a large mixing bowl add 8 ounces of the ground chicken, mashed
        chickpeas, finely minced onion, smoked paprika, and chile powder. Mix
        with your hands until a loose but homogenous mixture forms. Form the
        chicken and chickpea mixture into 3 to 4 evenly sized burgers. Make them
        a little wider than your bun with an indentation as they will shrink
        when cooking. Generously salt and pepper the exterior of the burgers.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the stove, set a cast iron over medium heat and add in a half
        tablespoon of peanut oil. Once hot, place the patty away from you and
        cook until browned and the exterior starts to crisp up about 3 to 4
        minutes. Flip the burger and cook for another 3-4 minutes. If using, add
        the cheese at the last minute to melt. Pull the burgers off when the
        internal temp is 165 and it is nicely browned on the exterior.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble the burger with a toasted bun, yogurt sauce, tomatoes, lettuce,
        and pickled onion or whatever your desired toppings are.
      </li>
    </ol>
