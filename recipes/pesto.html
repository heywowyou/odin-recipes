        <h3>Pesto alla genovese</h3>

            <p>Traditional pesto is a blend of fresh basil, garlic, pine nuts, extra-virgin olive oil, and Parmesan cheese.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Fresh basil</li>
                <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>Garlic cloves</li>
                <li>Pine nuts</li>
                <li>Freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>Coarse salt</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Dry pasta</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Add the garlic cloves with a tiny pinch of salt to the mortar. Using the pestle, crush the garlic into a rough paste.</li>
                <li>Add the pine nuts and grind with the garlic into a smooth paste.</li>
                <li>Add the basil leaves with another pinch of salt. Using the pestle with a rotary movement, grind all the ingredients against the side of the mortar. When they have been ground into a paste, add both the grated parm and romano cheeses and grind them evenly into the mixture.</li>
                <li>Set the pestle aside and grab a spoon or spatula. Add the olive oil in a very thin stream, beating it into the mixture with the spoon. When all the oil has been incorporated, beat in the butter with the spoon, distributing it evenly.</li>
                <li>To serve with pasta, reserve a half cup of the pasta water and transfer the cooked pasta to a large bowl. Spoon the pesto over top with a couple of spoon fulls of the starchy pasta water to dilute and create a cohesive sauce. Serve with more parm, fresh basil, or diced fresh tomatoes.</li>
            </ol>
